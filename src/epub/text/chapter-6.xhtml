			<p>Now there are some things frankly impossible. The weakest intellect will admit this situation is impossible. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Athenaeum</i> will probably say as much should it venture to review this. Sunbespattered ferns, spreading beech trees, the Vicar and the gun are acceptable enough. But this Angel is a different matter. Plain sensible people will scarcely go on with such an extravagant book. And the Vicar fully appreciated this impossibility. But he lacked decision. Consequently he went on with it, as you shall immediately hear. He was hot, it was after dinner, he was in no mood for mental subtleties. The Angel had him at a disadvantage, and further distracted him from the main issue by irrelevant iridescence and a violent fluttering. For the moment it never occurred to the Vicar to ask whether the Angel was possible or not. He accepted him in the confusion of the moment, and the mischief was done. Put yourself in his place, my dear <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Athenaeum</i>. You go out shooting. You hit something. That alone would disconcert you. You find you have hit an Angel, and he writhes about for a minute and then sits up and addresses you. He makes no apology for his own impossibility. Indeed, he carries the charge clean into your camp. “A man!” he says, pointing. “A man in the maddest black clothes and without a feather upon him. Then I was not deceived. I am indeed in the Land of Dreams!” You <em>must</em> answer him. Unless you take to your heels. Or blow his brains out with your second barrel as an escape from the controversy.</p>
			<p>“The Land of Dreams! Pardon me if I suggest you have just come out of it,” was the Vicar’s remark.</p>
			<p>“How can that be?” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“Your wing,” said the Vicar, “is bleeding. Before we talk, may I have the pleasure⁠—the melancholy pleasure⁠—of tying it up? I am really most sincerely sorry. …” The Angel put his hand behind his back and winced.</p>
			<p>The Vicar assisted his victim to stand up. The Angel turned gravely and the Vicar, with numberless insignificant panting parentheses, carefully examined the injured wings. (They articulated, he observed with interest, to a kind of second glenoid on the outer and upper edge of the shoulder blade. The left wing had suffered little except the loss of some of the primary wing-quills, and a shot or so in the <em>ala spuria</em>, but the humerus bone of the right was evidently smashed.) The Vicar stanched the bleeding as well as he could and tied up the bone with his pocket handkerchief and the neck wrap his housekeeper made him carry in all weathers.</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid you will not be able to fly for some time,” said he, feeling the bone.</p>
			<p>“I don’t like this new sensation,” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“The Pain when I feel your bone?”</p>
			<p>“The <em>what</em>?” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“The Pain.”</p>
			<p>“ ‘Pain’⁠—you call it. No, I certainly don’t like the Pain. Do you have much of this Pain in the Land of Dreams?”</p>
			<p>“A very fair share,” said the Vicar. “Is it new to you?”</p>
			<p>“Quite,” said the Angel. “I don’t like it.”</p>
			<p>“How curious!” said the Vicar, and bit at the end of a strip of linen to tie a knot. “I think this bandaging must serve for the present,” he said. “I’ve studied ambulance work before, but never the bandaging up of wing wounds. Is your Pain any better?”</p>
			<p>“It glows now instead of flashing,” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“I am afraid you will find it glow for some time,” said the Vicar, still intent on the wound.</p>
			<p>The Angel gave a shrug of the wing and turned round to look at the Vicar again. He had been trying to keep an eye on the Vicar over his shoulder during all their interview. He looked at him from top to toe with raised eyebrows and a growing smile on his beautiful soft-featured face. “It seems so odd,” he said with a sweet little laugh, “to be talking to a Man!”</p>
			<p>“Do you know,” said the Vicar, “now that I come to think of it, it is equally odd to me that I should be talking to an Angel. I am a somewhat matter-of-fact person. A Vicar has to be. Angels I have always regarded as⁠—artistic conceptions⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Exactly what we think of men.”</p>
			<p>“But surely you have seen so many men⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Never before today. In pictures and books, times enough of course. But I have seen several since the sunrise, solid real men, besides a horse or so⁠—those Unicorn things you know, without horns⁠—and quite a number of those grotesque knobby things called ‘cows.’ I was naturally a little frightened at so many mythical monsters, and came to hide here until it was dark. I suppose it will be dark again presently like it was at first. <em>Phew!</em> This Pain of yours is poor fun. I hope I shall wake up directly.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t understand quite,” said the Vicar, knitting his brows and tapping his forehead with his flat hand. “Mythical monster!” The worst thing he had been called for years hitherto was a ‘medieval anachronism’ (by an advocate of Disestablishment). “Do I understand that you consider me as⁠—as something in a dream?”</p>
			<p>“Of course,” said the Angel smiling.</p>
			<p>“And this world about me, these rugged trees and spreading fronds⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Is all so <em>very</em> dreamlike,” said the Angel. “Just exactly what one dreams of⁠—or artists imagine.”</p>
			<p>“You have artists then among the Angels?”</p>
			<p>“All kinds of artists, Angels with wonderful imaginations, who invent men and cows and eagles and a thousand impossible creatures.”</p>
			<p>“Impossible creatures!” said the Vicar.</p>
			<p>“Impossible creatures,” said the Angel. “Myths.”</p>
			<p>“But I’m real!” said the Vicar. “I assure you I’m real.”</p>
			<p>The Angel shrugged his wings and winced and smiled. “I can always tell when I am dreaming,” he said.</p>
			<p>“<em>You</em>⁠—dreaming,” said the Vicar. He looked round him.</p>
			<p>“<em>You</em> dreaming!” he repeated. His mind worked diffusely.</p>
			<p>He held out his hand with all his fingers moving. “I have it!” he said. “I begin to see.” A really brilliant idea was dawning upon his mind. He had not studied mathematics at Cambridge for nothing, after all. “Tell me please. Some animals of <em>your</em> world … of the Real World, real animals you know.”</p>
			<p>“Real animals!” said the Angel smiling. “Why⁠—there’s Griffins and Dragons⁠—and Jabberwocks⁠—and Cherubim⁠—and Sphinxes⁠—and the Hippogriff⁠—and Mermaids⁠—and Satyrs⁠—and. …”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” said the Vicar as the Angel appeared to be warming to his work; “thank you. That is <em>quite</em> enough. I begin to understand.”</p>
			<p>He paused for a moment, his face pursed up. “Yes … I begin to see it.”</p>
			<p>“See what?” asked the Angel.</p>
			<p>“The Griffins and Satyrs and so forth. It’s as clear. …”</p>
			<p>“I don’t see them,” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“No, the whole point is they are not to be seen in this world. But our men with imaginations have told us all about them, you know. And even I at times … there are places in this village where you must simply take what they set before you, or give offence⁠—I, I say, have seen in my dreams Jabberwocks, Bogle brutes, Mandrakes. … From our point of view, you know, they are Dream Creatures. …”</p>
			<p>“Dream Creatures!” said the Angel. “How singular! This is a very curious dream. A kind of topsy-turvey one. You call men real and angels a myth. It almost makes one think that in some odd way there must be two worlds as it were. …”</p>
			<p>“At least Two,” said the Vicar.</p>
			<p>“Lying somewhere close together, and yet scarcely suspecting. …”</p>
			<p>“As near as page to page of a book.”</p>
			<p>“Penetrating each other, living each its own life. This is really a delicious dream!”</p>
			<p>“And never dreaming of each other.”</p>
			<p>“Except when people go a dreaming!”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said the Angel thoughtfully. “It must be something of the sort. And that reminds me. Sometimes when I have been dropping asleep, or drowsing under the noontide sun, I have seen strange corrugated faces just like yours, going by me, and trees with green leaves upon them, and such queer uneven ground as this. … It must be so. I have fallen into another world.”</p>
			<p>“Sometimes,” began the Vicar, “at bedtime, when I have been just on the edge of consciousness, I have seen faces as beautiful as yours, and the strange dazzling vistas of a wonderful scene, that flowed past me, winged shapes soaring over it, and wonderful⁠—sometimes terrible⁠—forms going to and fro. I have even heard sweet music too in my ears. … It may be that as we withdraw our attention from the world of sense, the pressing world about us, as we pass into the twilight of repose, other worlds. … Just as we see the stars, those other worlds in space, when the glare of day recedes. … And the artistic dreamers who see such things most clearly. …”</p>
			<p>They looked at one another.</p>
			<p>“And in some incomprehensible manner I have fallen into this world of yours out of my own!” said the Angel, “into the world of my dreams, grown real.”</p>
			<p>He looked about him. “Into the world of my dreams.”</p>
			<p>“It is confusing,” said the Vicar. “It almost makes one think there may be (ahem) Four Dimensions after all. In which case, of course,” he went on hurriedly⁠—for he loved geometrical speculations and took a certain pride in his knowledge of them⁠—“there may be any number of three dimensional universes packed side by side, and all dimly dreaming of one another. There may be world upon world, universe upon universe. It’s perfectly possible. There’s nothing so incredible as the absolutely possible. But I wonder how you came to fall out of your world into mine. …”</p>
			<p>“Dear me!” said the Angel; “There’s deer and a stag! Just as they draw them on the coats of arms. How grotesque it all seems! Can I really be awake?”</p>
			<p>He rubbed his knuckles into his eyes.</p>
			<p>The half-dozen of dappled deer came in Indian file obliquely through the trees and halted, watching. “It’s no dream⁠—I am really a solid concrete Angel, in Dream Land,” said the Angel. He laughed. The Vicar stood surveying him. The Reverend gentleman was pulling his mouth askew after a habit he had, and slowly stroking his chin. He was asking himself whether he too was not in the Land of Dreams.</p>
