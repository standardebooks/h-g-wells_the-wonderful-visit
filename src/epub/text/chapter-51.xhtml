			<p>But when he came over the brow of the moor, a vivid light sprang up before him and refused to be ignored. He came on down the hill and speedily saw more distinctly what the glare was. It came from darting and trembling tongues of fire, golden and red, that shot from the windows and a hole in the roof of the Vicarage. A cluster of black heads, all the village in fact, except the fire-brigade⁠—who were down at Aylmer’s Cottage trying to find the key of the machine-house⁠—came out in silhouette against the blaze. There was a roaring sound, and a humming of voices, and presently a furious outcry. There was a shouting of “No! No!”⁠—“Come back!” and an inarticulate roar.</p>
			<p>He began to run towards the burning house. He stumbled and almost fell, but he ran on. He found black figures running about him. The flaring fire blew gustily this way and that, and he smelt the smell of burning.</p>
			<p>“She went in,” said one voice, “she went in.”</p>
			<p>“The mad girl!” said another.</p>
			<p>“Stand back! Stand back!” cried others.</p>
			<p>He found himself thrusting through an excited, swaying crowd, all staring at the flames, and with the red reflection in their eyes.</p>
			<p>“Stand back!” said a labourer, clutching him.</p>
			<p>“What is it?” said the Angel. “What does this mean?”</p>
			<p>“There’s a girl in the house, and she can’t get out!”</p>
			<p>“Went in after a fiddle,” said another.</p>
			<p>“ ‘Tas hopeless,” he heard someone else say.</p>
			<p>“I was standing near her. I heerd her. Says she: ‘I <em>can</em> get his fiddle.’ I heerd her⁠—Just like that! ‘I <em>can</em> get his fiddle.’ ”</p>
			<p>For a moment the Angel stood staring. Then in a flash he saw it all, saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured in a splendour that outshone the Angelic Land, suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of Love and Self-Sacrifice. He gave a strange cry, and before anyone could stop him, was running towards the burning building. There were cries of “The Hunchback! The Fowener!”</p>
			<p>The Vicar, whose scalded hand was being tied up, turned his head, and he and Crump saw the Angel, a black outline against the intense, red glare of the doorway. It was the sensation of the tenth of a second, yet both men could not have remembered that transitory attitude more vividly had it been a picture they had studied for hours together. Then the Angel was hidden by something massive (no one knew what) that fell, incandescent, across the doorway.</p>
