			<p>After that incident the Angel walked along past the mill and round behind the church, to examine the tombstones.</p>
			<p>“This seems to be the place where they put the broken pieces,” said the Angel⁠—reading the inscriptions. “Curious word⁠—relict! Resurgam! Then they are not done with quite. What a huge pile it requires to keep her down. … It is spirited of her.”</p>
			<p>“Hawkins?” said the Angel softly, … “<em>Hawkins?</em> The name is strange to me. … He did not die then. … It is plain enough⁠—Joined the Angelic Hosts, <time datetime="1863-05-17">May 17, 1863</time>. He must have felt as much out of place as I do down here. But I wonder why they put that little pot thing on the top of this monument. Curious! There are several others about⁠—little stone pots with a rag of stiff stone drapery over them.”</p>
			<p>Just then the boys came pouring out of the National School, and first one and then several stopped agape at the Angel’s crooked black figure among the white tombs. “Ent ’e gart a baak on en!” remarked one critic.</p>
			<p>“ ’E’s got ’air like a girl!” said another.</p>
			<p>The Angel turned towards them. He was struck by the queer little heads sticking up over the lichenous wall. He smiled faintly at their staring faces, and then turned to marvel at the iron railings that enclosed the Fitz-Jarvis tomb. “A queer air of uncertainty,” he said. “Slabs, piles of stone, these railings. … Are they afraid? … Do these Dead ever try and get up again? There’s an air of repression⁠—fortification⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Get yer <em>’air</em> cut, Get yer <em>’air</em> cut,” sang three little boys together.</p>
			<p>“Curious these Human Beings are!” said the Angel. “That man yesterday wanted to cut off my wings, now these little creatures want me to cut off my hair! And the man on the bridge offered to take the ‘paint’ off me. They will leave nothing of me soon.”</p>
			<p>“Where did you get that <em>’at</em>?” sang another little boy. “Where did you get them clo’es?”</p>
			<p>“They ask questions that they evidently do not want answered,” said the Angel. “I can tell from the tone.” He looked thoughtfully at the little boys. “I don’t understand the methods of Human intercourse. These are probably friendly advances, a kind of ritual. But I don’t know the responses. I think I will go back to the little fat man in black, with the gold chain across his stomach, and ask him to explain. It is difficult.”</p>
			<p>He turned towards the lych gate. “<em>Oh!</em>” said one of the little boys, in a shrill falsetto, and threw a beechnut husk. It came bounding across the churchyard path. The Angel stopped in surprise.</p>
			<p>This made all the little boys laugh. A second imitating the first, said “<em>Oh!</em>” and hit the Angel. His astonishment was really delicious. They all began crying “<em>Oh!</em>” and throwing beechnut husks. One hit the Angel’s hand, another stung him smartly by the ear. The Angel made ungainly movements towards them. He spluttered some expostulation and made for the roadway. The little boys were amazed and shocked at his discomfiture and cowardice. Such sawney behaviour could not be encouraged. The pelting grew vigorously. You may perhaps be able to imagine those vivid moments, daring small boys running in close and delivering shots, milder small boys rushing round behind with flying discharges. Milton Screever’s mongrel dog was roused to yelping ecstacy at the sight, and danced (full of wild imaginings) nearer and nearer to the angelic legs.</p>
			<p>“Hi, hi!” said a vigorous voice. “I never did! Where’s <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarvis? Manners, manners! you young rascals.”</p>
			<p>The youngsters scattered right and left, some over the wall into the playground, some down the street.</p>
			<p>“Frightful pest these boys are getting!” said Crump, coming up. “I’m sorry they have been annoying you.”</p>
			<p>The Angel seemed quite upset. “I don’t understand,” he said. “These Human ways. …”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course. Unusual to you. How’s your excrescence?”</p>
			<p>“My what?” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“Bifid limb, you know. How is it? Now you’re down this way, come in. Come in and let me have a look at it again. You young roughs! And meanwhile these little louts of ours will be getting off home. They’re all alike in these villages. <em>Can’t</em> understand anything abnormal. See an odd-looking stranger. Chuck a stone. No imagination beyond the parish. … (I’ll give you physic if I catch you annoying strangers again.) … I suppose it’s what one might expect. … Come along this way.”</p>
			<p>So the Angel, horribly perplexed still, was hurried into the surgery to have his wound redressed.</p>
