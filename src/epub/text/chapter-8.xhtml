			<p>“I have,” said the Angel, “a most unusual feeling⁠—<em>here</em>. Have had since sunrise. I don’t remember ever having any feeling⁠—<em>here</em> before.”</p>
			<p>“Not pain, I hope,” said the Vicar.</p>
			<p>“Oh no! It is quite different from that⁠—a kind of vacuous feeling.”</p>
			<p>“The atmospheric pressure, perhaps, is a little different,” the Vicar began, feeling his chin.</p>
			<p>“And do you know, I have also the most curious sensations in my mouth⁠—almost as if⁠—it’s so absurd!⁠—as if I wanted to stuff things into it.”</p>
			<p>“Bless me!” said the Vicar. “Of course! You’re hungry!”</p>
			<p>“Hungry!” said the Angel. “What’s that?”</p>
			<p>“Don’t you eat?”</p>
			<p>“Eat! The word’s quite new to me.”</p>
			<p>“Put food into your mouth, you know. One has to here. You will soon learn. If you don’t, you get thin and miserable, and suffer a great deal⁠—<em>pain</em>, you know⁠—and finally you die.”</p>
			<p>“Die!” said the Angel. “That’s another strange word!”</p>
			<p>“It’s not strange here. It means leaving off, you know,” said the Vicar.</p>
			<p>“We never leave off,” said the Angel.</p>
			<p>“You don’t know what may happen to you in this world,” said the Vicar, thinking him over. “Possibly if you are feeling hungry, and can feel pain and have your wings broken, you may even have to die before you get out of it again. At anyrate you had better try eating. For my own part⁠—ahem!⁠—there are many more disagreeable things.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose I <em>had</em> better Eat,” said the Angel. “If it’s not too difficult. I don’t like this ‘Pain’ of yours, and I don’t like this ‘Hungry.’ If your ‘Die’ is anything like it, I would prefer to Eat. What a very odd world this is!”</p>
			<p>“To Die,” said the Vicar, “is generally considered worse than either pain or hunger. … It depends.”</p>
			<p>“You must explain all that to me later,” said the Angel. “Unless I wake up. At present, please show me how to eat. If you will. I feel a kind of urgency. …”</p>
			<p>“Pardon me,” said the Vicar, and offered an elbow. “If I may have the pleasure of entertaining you. My house lies yonder⁠—not a couple of miles from here.”</p>
			<p>“<em>Your</em> House!” said the Angel a little puzzled; but he took the Vicar’s arm affectionately, and the two, conversing as they went, waded slowly through the luxuriant bracken, sun mottled under the trees, and on over the stile in the park palings, and so across the bee-swarming heather for a mile or more, down the hillside, home.</p>
			<p>You would have been charmed at the couple could you have seen them. The Angel, slight of figure, scarcely five feet high, and with a beautiful, almost effeminate face, such as an Italian old Master might have painted. (Indeed, there is one in the National Gallery [<i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">Tobias and the Angel</i>, by some artist unknown] not at all unlike him so far as face and spirit go.) He was robed simply in a purple-wrought saffron blouse, bare kneed and bare-footed, with his wings (broken now, and a leaden grey) folded behind him. The Vicar was a short, rather stout figure, rubicund, red-haired, clean-shaven, and with bright ruddy brown eyes. He wore a piebald straw hat with a black ribbon, a very neat white tie, and a fine gold watch-chain. He was so greatly interested in his companion that it only occurred to him when he was in sight of the Vicarage that he had left his gun lying just where he had dropped it amongst the bracken.</p>
			<p>He was rejoiced to hear that the pain of the bandaged wing fell rapidly in intensity.</p>
