			<p>Then the Angel came in sight of the forge, where Sandy Bright’s brother was shoeing a horse for the carter from Upmorton. Two hobbledehoys were standing by the forge staring in a bovine way at the proceedings. As the Angel approached these two and then the carter turned slowly through an angle of thirty degrees and watched his approach, staring quietly and steadily at him. The expression on their faces was one of abstract interest.</p>
			<p>The Angel became self-conscious for the first time in his life. He drew nearer, trying to maintain an amiable expression on his face, an expression that beat in vain against their granitic stare. His hands were behind him. He smiled pleasantly, looking curiously at the (to him) incomprehensible employment of the smith. But the battery of eyes seemed to angle for his regard. Trying to meet the three pairs at once, the Angel lost his alertness and stumbled over a stone. One of the yokels gave a sarcastic cough, and was immediately covered with confusion at the Angel’s enquiring gaze, nudging his companion with his elbow to cover his disorder. None spoke, and the Angel did not speak.</p>
			<p>So soon as the Angel had passed, one of the three hummed this tune in an aggressive tone.</p>

			<p>Then all three of them laughed. One tried to sing something and found his throat contained phlegm. The Angel proceeded on his way.</p>
			<p>“Who’s <em>e</em> then?” said the second hobbledehoy.</p>
			<p>“Ping, ping, ping,” went the blacksmith’s hammer.</p>
			<p>“Spose he’s one of these here foweners,” said the carter from Upmorton. “Daamned silly fool he do look to be sure.”</p>
			<p>“Tas the way with them foweners,” said the first hobbledehoy sagely.</p>
			<p>“Got something very like the ’ump,” said the carter from Upmorton. “Daa-a-amned if ’e ent.”</p>
			<p>Then the silence healed again, and they resumed their quiet expressionless consideration of the Angel’s retreating figure.</p>
			<p>“Very like the ’ump et is,” said the carter after an enormous pause.</p>
