			<p>This section is (so far as my memory goes) the shortest in the book.</p>
			<p>But the enormity of the offence necessitates the separation of this section from all other sections.</p>
			<p>The Vicar, you must understand, had done his best to inculcate the recognised differentiae of a gentleman. “Never allow a lady to carry anything,” said the Vicar. “Say, ‘permit me’ and relieve her.” “Always stand until every lady is seated.” “Always rise and open a door for a lady. …” and so forth. (All men who have elder sisters know that code.)</p>
			<p>And the Angel (who had failed to relieve Lady Hammergallow of her teacup) danced forward with astonishing dexterity (leaving <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Jehoram in the window seat) and with an elegant “permit me” rescued the tea-tray from Lady Hammergallow’s pretty parlourmaid and vanished officiously in front of her. The Vicar rose to his feet with an inarticulate cry.</p>
