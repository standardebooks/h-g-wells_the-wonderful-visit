			<p>“He’s drunk!” said Mr. Rathbone-Slater, breaking a terrific silence. “That’s the matter with <i>him</i>.”</p>
			<p>Mrs. Jehoram laughed hysterically.</p>
			<p>The Vicar stood up, motionless, staring. “Oh! I <i>forgot</i> to explain servants to him!” said the Vicar to himself in a swift outbreak of remorse. “I thought he <i>did</i> understand servants.”</p>
			<p>“Really, Mr. Hilyer!” said Lady Hammergallow, evidently exercising enormous self-control and speaking in panting spasms. “Really, Mr. Hilyer!⁠—Your genius is <i>too</i> terrible. I must, I really <i>must</i>, ask you to take him home.”</p>
			<p>So to the dialogue in the corridor of alarmed maid-servant and well-meaning (but shockingly <i>gauche</i>) Angel⁠—appears the Vicar, his botryoidal little face crimson, gaunt despair in his eyes, and his necktie under his left ear.</p>
			<p>“Come,” he said⁠—struggling with emotion. “Come away. … I. … I am disgraced for ever.”</p>
			<p>And the Angel stared for a second at him and obeyed⁠—meekly, perceiving himself in the presence of unknown but evidently terrible forces.</p>
			<p>And so began and ended the Angel’s social career.</p>
			<p>In the informal indignation meeting that followed, Lady Hammergallow took the (informal) chair. “I feel humiliated,” she said. “The Vicar assured me he was an exquisite player. I never imagined. …”</p>
			<p>“He was drunk,” said Mr. Rathbone-Slater. “You could tell it from the way he fumbled with his tea.”</p>
			<p>“Such a <i>fiasco</i>!” said Mrs. Mergle.</p>
			<p>“The Vicar assured me,” said Lady Hammergallow. “ ‘The man I have staying with me is a musical genius,’ he said. His very words.”</p>
			<p>“His ears must be burning anyhow,” said Tommy Rathbone-Slater.</p>
			<p>“I was trying to keep him Quiet,” said Mrs. Jehoram. “By humouring him. And do you know the things he said to me⁠—there!”</p>
			<p>“The thing he played,” said Mr. Wilmerdings,”⁠—I must confess I did not like to charge him to his face. But really! It was merely <i>drifting</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Just fooling with a fiddle, eigh?” said George Harringay. “Well I thought it was beyond me. So much of your fine music is⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <i>George</i>!” said the younger Miss Pirbright.</p>
			<p>“The Vicar was a bit on too⁠—to judge by his tie,” said Mr. Rathbone-Slater. “It’s a dashed rummy go. Did you notice how he fussed after the genius?”</p>
			<p>“One has to be so very careful,” said the very eldest Miss Papaver.</p>
			<p>“He told me he is in love with the Vicar’s housemaid!” said Mrs. Jehoram. “I almost laughed in his face.”</p>
			<p>“The Vicar ought <i>never</i> to have brought him here,” said Mrs. Rathbone-Slater with decision.</p>
